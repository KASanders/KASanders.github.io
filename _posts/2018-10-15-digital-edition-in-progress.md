I'm excited to finally make available my ongoing digital humanities project, which
is a digital edition of John Moschus' _Spiritual Meadow_.

This late Greek (6-7th c. CE) collection of tall tales and entertaining anecdotes was gathered during John's extensive travels around the Levant, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, with stories including:
<ul><li>
Mimes mutilated by the Theotokos
</li>
<li>
Pillar saints incinerated by lightning
</li>
<li>
Talking corpses with decent advice
</li>
<li>
Heartwarming lions
</li>
<li>
Herodotean fish
</li>
</ul>


The project is currently in progress and can be viewed [here](http://pratum-spirituale.herokuapp.com/). If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request to [github](https://github.com/KASanders/ps).
