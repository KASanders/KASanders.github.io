# Education and Current Research
I received my Ph.D. in Classics from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2018. My dissertation, "Pindar and the Enigmatic Tradition," considers questions such as:
<ul> <li>
Why are there so many child riddlers in Greek literature?
</li>
<li>
Who killed Homer anyways?
</li>
<li>
What cow is white, red, and black?
</li></ul>


I'm currently revising the project into a monograph. If you're into Pindar, riddles, or anything remotely similar, drop me a line.

I'm also working on a digital project: a critical edition of John Moschus' Spiritual Meadow. This late Greek (6-7th c. CE) collection of tall tales and entertaining anecdotes was gathered during John's extensive travels around the Levant, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, with stories including:
<ul><li>
Mimes mutilated by the Theotokos
</li>
<li>
Pillar saints incinerated by lightning
</li>
<li>
Talking corpses with decent advice
</li>
<li>
Heartwarming lions
</li>
<li>
Herodotean fish
</li>
</ul>

Using Tesseract OCR, I have digitized all 219 of these stories (c. 60k words). Please contact me if you would like the Greek text. It makes for great supplemental reading for intermediate students!

I am working to encode the text to the latest TEI/ Epidoc standards. A further goal is to collate several manuscripts to produce an app crit, as well as the integration of mapping tools.
