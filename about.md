I'm currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of the South (Sewanee) in Sewanee, TN, where I live with my wife Hannah and my dog Hugo.
I graduated from Davidson College with a BA in Classics in 2011. I'm originally from central Florida. My hobbies include cultivating bonsai, baking sourdough bread, and trail running.

# Research Interests
<ul><li>Greek Poetry: Lyric, Tragedy</li> <li>Riddles and Fables; Popular Literature</li> <li>Digital approaches to scholarship and pedagogy</li></ul>

# Education and Current Research
I received my Ph.D. in Classics from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2018. My dissertation, "Pindar and the Enigmatic Tradition," considers questions such as:
<ul> <li>
Why are there so many child riddlers in Greek literature?
</li>
<li>
Who killed Homer anyways?
</li>
<li>
What cow is white, red, and black?
</li></ul>


I'm currently revising the project into a monograph. If you're into Pindar, riddles, or anything remotely similar, drop me a line.

I'm also working on a digital project: a critical edition of John Moschus' <em>Spiritual Meadow</em>. See [Projects](/projects/).
